Понимаете основы реактивности:
- отличаете ref и reactive (включая shallow) V
- computed от methods V
- get/set computed V

Можете написать кастомный
- Composable V

Container query is cool, I want to try that.
It's really usable with columns and sidebars.

Each counter has a:
Title
Description
Current
Max

I need a database then? A firebase?
I am lazy about attaching the firebase. Let's do it.

---

I want to add a createdAt field in the firebase.
I want to add routing to allow for switching between routes,
meaning I want to save a new counter with a slug V

Manually adding slugs in firebase is a waste of time


I will only fetch the counters I open.  The dice decided so.
I need the slug to be the identifier

Ok, now I want to add this feature where I could update the values on firebase

PWA requirements:

- A valid JSON manifest of the app’s info, with the correct info filled in
- A JavaScript service worker (to allow the site to load offline and store data locally)
- A set of properly named icons, at multiple sizes
- A secure, HTTPS connection

What good could be said about this project?
1. I've further familiarized myself with the Composition API
2. I've got a taste of tailwind
3. Dusted-off my firebase skills
4. I am getting the flow of working with copilot, it's really helpful
5. I am building something I am really going to use
6. Got a taste of PWA

I want to make it look eye-candy. With glows and shit.
